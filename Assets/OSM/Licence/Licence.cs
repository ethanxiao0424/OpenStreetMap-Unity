     * Firstly, that you attribute OpenStreetMap, i.e. you show clearly where you got the data from. A lot of contributors have spent and spend a lot of time and effort adding data from virtually every country in the world. We would also like people to know about our project and perhaps use or contribute data themselves.
     * Secondly, you "Share Alike". If you do not make any changes to OpenStreetMap data, then you are unlikely to have a "Share Alike" obligation. But, if you publicly distribute something that you have made from our data, such as a map or another database, AND you have added to or enhanced our data, then we want you to make those additions publicly available. We obviously prefer it if you added the data straight back to our database, but you do not have to, as long as the public can easily get a copy of what you have done. If you do not publicly distribute anything, then you do not have to share anything.

     * - Use OSM data, not tile server, to avoid heavy traffic on tile server
